For example, if we want to solve the equation:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{Ax=y} $$\nIf the matrix \\(\\boldsymbol{A}\\) is invertible then the solution is \\(\\boldsymbol{x = A^{-1}y}\\). What if \\(\\boldsymbol{A}\\) is not invertible, we can define the pseudoinverse of A as:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{A^+ = \\lim_{\\delta\\to 0}(A^{\\top}A + \\delta^2I)^{-1}A^{\\top}} $$\nwhere \\(\\boldsymbol{\\delta}\\) is added to prevent \\(\\boldsymbol{A^{\\top}A}\\) reach zero.","date":"2023-08-17T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://monte-cario.github.io/blog/pseudoinverse/","tags":["Linear Algebra"],"title":"The Moore-Penrose Pseudoinverse"}]
