      <description>Information theory Intuition The basic intuition behind information theory is that learning that an unlikely event has occurred is more informative than learning that a likely event has occurred. A message saying “the sun rose this morning” is so uninformative as to be unnecessary to send, but a message saying “there was a solar eclipse this morning” is very informative.
Independent events should have additive information. For example, the information gained from the event that a tossed coin has come up as heads twice is double than the event a tossed coin has come up as heads once.</description>
