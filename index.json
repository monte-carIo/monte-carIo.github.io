In other words, it quantifies the relationship between two variables and indicates whether they tend to increase or decrease together. It is an important concept in understanding the joint behavior of variables and is widely used in statistics, probability theory, and data analysis:\n$$ Cov(f(x), g(y)) = E[(f(x) - E[f(x)])(g(y) - E[g(y)])] $$","date":"2023-08-18T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://monte-cario.github.io/blog/prob/","tags":["Probability and Information Theory"],"title":"Concepts of Covariance, the Dirac Distribution and Empirical Distribution"},{"author":"Monte Carlo","categories":null,"contents":"Intuition The basic intuition behind information theory is that learning that an unlikely event has occurred is more informative than learning that a likely event has occurred. A message saying “the sun rose this morning” is so uninformative as to be unnecessary to send, but a message saying “there was a solar eclipse this morning” is very informative.\nIndependent events should have additive information. For example, the information gained from the event that a tossed coin has come up as heads twice is double than the event a tossed coin has come up as heads once.","date":"2023-08-18T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://monte-cario.github.io/blog/infor/","tags":["Probability and Information Theory"],"title":"Information Theory"},{"author":"Monte Carlo","categories":null,"contents":"Definition As we learned in linear algebra, we can not inverse a matrix if it is not square. For example, if we want to solve the equation:\n$$ \\boldsymbol{Ax=y} $$\nIf the matrix \\(\\boldsymbol{A}\\) is invertible then the solution is \\(\\boldsymbol{x = A^{-1}y}\\).
